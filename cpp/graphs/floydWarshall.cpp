// The Floyd-Warshall algorithm, named after its creators Robert Floyd and Stephen Warshall, is a fundamental algorithm in computer science 
// and graph theory. 
// It is used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph. 
// This algorithm is highly efficient and can handle graphs with both positive and negative edge weights, 
// making it a versatile tool for solving a wide range of network and connectivity problems.

// The Floyd Warshall Algorithm is an all pair shortest path algorithm unlike Dijkstra and Bellman Ford 
// which are single source shortest path algorithms. 
// This algorithm works for both the directed and undirected weighted graphs. 
// But, it does not work for the graphs with negative cycles (where the sum of the edges in a cycle is negative). 

// It follows Dynamic Programming approach to check every possible path going via every possible node in order 
// to calculate shortest distance between every pair of nodes.

// Use floydWarshall's algorithm for finding the shorest path for every pair of vertices



// Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:

// Pros:

// Efficient: Finds shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a graph.
// Versatile: Handles graphs with both positive and negative edge weights.
// All-Pairs: Unlike Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford, it computes all pair shortest paths.


// Cons:
//
// Complexity: Time complexity is cubic, Î˜(V^3), which can be inefficient for large graphs.
// Negative Cycles: Doesn't work for graphs with negative cycles, limiting its applicability.


// remember the forumla A^kth[i,j] = min{A^(k-1)th[i,j], A^(k-1)[i,k] + A^(k-1)[k,j]}
// the ^k part just means the kth matrix i.e. the shorest path matrix for vertex k
